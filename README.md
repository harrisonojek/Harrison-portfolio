# Harrison Ekuetafia – Personal Brand Site

This is the source code for my personal website.

**Key themes:**

- Synthetic indices trading on Deriv  
- Aspiring data & financial analyst  
- Culture shaping, nation building, and positioning Africa for global relevance  
- Dexora Group – a movement built on mastery, discipline, and evolution  

## Structure

- `index.html` – main single-page site
- `style.css` – styling (dark theme, responsive)
- `script.js` – small JavaScript for the dynamic year in the footer

## Deployment

This site is designed to be deployed on **Netlify** or any static hosting.

On Netlify:

1. Connect this GitHub repository to Netlify.
2. Set the build command to **none** (it's a static site).
3. Set the publish directory to the repo root (`/`).
4. Deploy.

Any changes you push to `index.html`, `style.css`, or `script.js` will trigger a new deploy.
